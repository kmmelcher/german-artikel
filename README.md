## How to use it

 Click on Artikel to practice the article of each word by choosing between der, die or das.

a point on falsh. If you go back to the Menu, your score will not be erased, only if you close 
the application.

 Click on Plural to practice the plural of each word. You must type the answer. Press enter when 
you're done and you will get your points just as in the artikel:

 Click on Wöerter to add new words. Enter the article, the word and the plural of the given word.
Press Hinzufügen to add it. By selecting a word on the list you can delete it using the button
löschen. You can also search for a word in the navigation bar.

 An alternative way of adding words is to enter the article, word and plural at the .txt file on the
bibliothek directory. You must follow this model: die Frau Frauen
